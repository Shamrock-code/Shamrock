# The Shamrock code

Shamrock is a general purpose HPC hydrodynamics simulation code focused on astrophysical contexts.  
The whole code is **C++17** by default, and all accelerated parts are done using **SYCL**, 
which can be directly compiled directly to native **CUDA**, **ROCM**, **OpenMP** and much more.
Shamrock also supports multiple GPUs and Heterogeneous clusters using **MPI**.  
This code aims to be: 
- Modern
- Modular  
- Fast 
- Portable
