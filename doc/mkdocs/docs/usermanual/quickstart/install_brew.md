# Shamrock install (Homebrew)

This is a homebrew tap that I maintain for Shamrock. Using the following command will compile and then install it.

```
brew install -v tdavidcl/shamrock/shamrock
```


!!! note

    I'm trying to get this package into homebrew core recently [homebrew-core PR #222322](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/222322).
    When this gets merged we will be able to use standard homebrew installs and use precompiled binaries.
